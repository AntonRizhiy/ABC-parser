# ABC-parser

The ABC parser project is a software development project that aims to create a parser for ABC files in the programming language C. The parser is designed to read and interpret ABC files, which are text-based files that contain musical notation. The project is developed using PsOC Creator, a development environment for embedded systems.

The parser is intended to be used with microcontroller-based systems that can receive data through UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter) via a terminal. Once the data is received, the parser will interpret it and generate output that can be used to control musical instruments or other devices.

The development of the parser involves several stages, including designing the parser algorithm, implementing the algorithm in C language, and testing the parser using sample ABC files. The parser will need to be able to handle a variety of input files, including those with different musical structures, tempo, and time signature.

The development of the ABC parser project will require knowledge of music notation and programming concepts such as parsing and data structures. Additionally, familiarity with UART communication protocols and using PsOC Creator for embedded system development will be essential.

Overall, the ABC parser project aims to provide a flexible and reliable parser for ABC files that can be integrated into microcontroller-based systems for musical applications.
